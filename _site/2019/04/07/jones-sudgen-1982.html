      <h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>

<p>Since Benthamâ€™s Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation, the dominant tradition in Anglo-American legal theory has been utilitarian. However, this approach is not always consistent with the principles by which legislators, judges and ordinary citizens evaluate legal arrangements; utilitarianism may be one important strand in popular thought about law and morality, but it is not the only one. In particular, it is doubtful whether liberal ideas can be satisfactorily formulated in a wholly utilitarian framework; and liberal principles surely have been, and are, influential in Western thought about what the law ought to be. In this paper we shall argue that some liberal objections to utilitarianism may be formulated in terms of a commitment to the value of individual choice. We shall offer some ideas about how the concept of individual choice should be analysed and we shall explore some of the implications of our analysis for legal theory.</p>

<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>

<p>Jones and Sugden take a thorough look at freedom of choice from a philosophical and a legal standpoint. The literature is a breezy read and looks at different schools of thought in an objective manner.</p>
