<p>The mobile gaming industry is growing at a rapid pace. Smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices are new channels to deliver games to customers. However, since the birth of Internet, users have been accustomed to getting things for free. How then are mobile game companies able to make billions € in revenue? What are the main drivers of profitability in this sector? Our objective is to dissect the freemium pricing strategy that is frequently used in the mobile gaming sector. With the help of the case study of Gameloft, we explore the method and the path for converting free into profit by playing with the users’ frustration and stress.</p>

<p>The emergence of the freemium business models in mobile gaming has always intrigued me. Freemium implies that the basic game features are available to all users for free, but they need to shell out money for certain premium features that enhance gameplay. I read this paper when I was exploring whether this is, at some level, an exploitation of humans at the hands of gaming companies. I am still unsure. This paper explores the emergence of the freemium model and paints a detailed picture of the mobile gaming market.</p>
