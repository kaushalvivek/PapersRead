      <h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>

<p>Complex computer games, especially massively multiplayer online games, contain narrative and mechanisms that mimic real economic activities, such as production, trade, and consumption. This has prompted some scholars to apply concepts and techniques from economics to study the complicated interactions inside games worlds. In this paper I review their work, attempt to argue why the approach has merit, and examine its limits and possibilities. In the final part I suggest a possible new avenue, using transaction cost economics to analyse and influence the size and composition of player guilds.</p>

<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>
<p>With the emergence of Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPG), an unprecedented and relatively un-studied world of economic transactions has emerged overnight. These transactions are in virtual money, which can often be traded for real money, and have a purpose – making gameplay more enjoyable. I studied this paper to better understand existing concepts of Virtual Economics – as the field is being called – to see if we can draw some important lessons from virtual economics which are applicable in the real world.</p>
