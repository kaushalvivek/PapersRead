      <h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>

<p>Studies of risk perception examine the judgments people make when they are asked to characterize and evaluate hazardous activities and technologies. This research aims to aid risk analysis and policy-making by providing a basis for understanding and anticipating public responses to hazards and improving the communication of risk information among lay people, technical experts, and decision-makers. This work assumes that those who promote and regulate health and safety need to understand how people think about and respond to risk. Without such understanding, well-intended policies may be ineffective.</p>

<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>
<p>Slovic, 1987 is a classic piece of literature in risk and forms the basis for a lot of research in the domain. It brought to light a mismatch between factors like the number of fatalities in an incident and the perceived social risk for the cause. For example, nuclear reactors are much feared when compared to Chemical Plants despite chemical plants being responsible for more fatalities over the last few decades. People fear what they perceive as unknown and uncontrollable, we don’t like things that we don’t understand. Our intuitions are biased based on this reasoning.</p>
