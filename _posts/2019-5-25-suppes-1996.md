# Abstract

This article develops an ergodic theory of freedom and its measurement. The key idea is that freedom and uncertainty are inextricably entwined. Measuretheoretic isomorphism of stationary processes is a natural way of identifying at an abstract level identity of the structure of uncertainty, which can be measured by the entropy rate of a stationary process. Various empirical examples of markets and elections are considered, as well as the Kantian, as opposed to utilitarian, philosophical framework of the general ideas.

# Notes

Suppes' paper on the nature and measurement of freedom is a modern classic in the theory on freedom of choice. It looks at various statistical and measuretheoretical models of freedom while also looking at different school's of philosophy and their views on freedom of choice. It makes for a very interesting read.
