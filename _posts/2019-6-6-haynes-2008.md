# Abstract

There has been a long controversy as to whether subjectively 'free' decisions are determined by brain activity ahead of time. We found that the outcome of a decision can be encoded in brain activity of prefrontal and parietal cortex up to 10 s before it enters awareness. This delay presumably reflects the operation of a network of high-level control areas that begin to prepare an upcoming decision long before it enters awareness.

# Notes

This paper takes a very close look at the human decision making process and analyses the existence of true free will from a neurological stand-point. Citing experiments where accurate predictions were made upto 10s prior to the decision maker's conscious awareness of the decision, the paper raises questions about our understanding of free will.
