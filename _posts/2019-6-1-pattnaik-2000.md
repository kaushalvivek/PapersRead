# Abstract

This paper examines how freedom of choice as reflected in an agent's opportunity sets can be measured in economic environments where opportunity sets are non empty and compact subsets of the non-negative orthant of the n-dimensional real space. Several plausible axioms are proposed for this purpose. It is then shown that, under different sets of axioms, one can represent the ranking of compact opportunity sets by different types of real-valued functions with intuitively plausible properties.

# Notes

This paper is a mathematical examination of freedom of choice, based on the axioms of set theory. I read this to expand my knowledge on the mathematical end of freedom of choice while working as a research assistant at the National Taiwan University.
